== Features ==

Walls.io puts all your social media feeds in one place, allows you to moderate the content, design the feed so that it matches your brand’s website, and even post custom content. Here are the main features of the Walls.io social media feed:

* It collects social content from multiple social platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Linkedin, ВКонтакте (VKontakte), Flickr, Tumblr, Reddit, Vimeo, Facebook Messenger, and others.
* It’s easy to customize in terms of design: you can choose from different themes and further customize backgrounds, fonts, tile colors and even use CSS for even more amazing design tweaks.
* It has a powerful spam detection algorithm behind it, and filters spam based on text analysis as well as image-based NSFW detection, which helps keep spammy posts away from your social feed.
* It offers advanced moderation options including language filters and blacklist filters for both keywords and profiles.
* It allows you to add your own content to the mix (not only social media posts): custom content can contain details about your next event, information about your latest product, posts promoting a great product feature, interesting facts about your company, testimonials from your clients or employees – you name it!
* The social feed is completely responsive and mobile-ready – social feed looks great on any screen size and in any container width
